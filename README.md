# Data Science Two Final Project

This repository contains files used for my final project in Data Science two. My project focused on examining the the factors that influence someone returning to prison after they are released. This repository is structured into four main folders:

* **data**, which contains the data downloaded from the [NIJ Recidivism Challenge](https://nij.ojp.gov/funding/recidivism-forecasting-challenge).
* **code**, which contains all the relevant scripts for preprocessing and analysis.
* **output**, which contains the presentation and the final report of this project.
